        <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
        <div class="muted small">Last Updated: January 2025</div>

        <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
        <p>
          By accessing and using the LuxuryBath Studio website and services, you
          accept and agree to be bound by the terms and provision of this
          agreement. If you do not agree to abide by the above, please do not
          use this service.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Services Description</h2>
        <p>
          LuxuryBath Studio provides professional bathroom remodeling services
          including but not limited to tub-to-shower conversions, shower-to-tub
          conversions, walk-in tub installations, acrylic bath walls, shower
          liners, bathtub liners, new tub installations, and new shower
          installations. All services are subject to availability and may vary
          based on location, project scope, and other factors.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Estimates and Pricing</h2>
        <p>
          We provide free estimates for all potential projects. Estimates are
          based on the information provided at the time of consultation and may
          be subject to change based on actual site conditions, changes in
          project scope, unforeseen complications, material price fluctuations,
          and other factors. Final pricing will be confirmed in writing before
          work begins. All prices are in U.S. dollars unless otherwise stated.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Payment Terms</h2>
        <p>
          Payment terms will be specified in your project contract. Generally: a
          deposit may be required to secure your project start date; progress
          payments may be required at various stages; final payment is due upon
          completion and acceptance of work. We accept cash, check, and major
          credit cards. Late payments may be subject to interest charges as
          specified in your contract.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Project Timeline</h2>
        <p>
          We strive to complete all projects within the estimated timeframe.
          However, project timelines are estimates and may be affected by
          weather conditions, material availability, permit processing times,
          unforeseen complications, and changes in project scope. We will
          communicate any significant delays promptly and work with you to
          minimize inconvenience.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Warranties</h2>
        <p>
          We provide warranties on our workmanship and materials as specified in
          your project contract. Warranties typically cover workmanship defects
          for a specified period, manufacturer warranties on materials and
          fixtures, and compliance with building codes and standards. Warranty
          claims must be made in writing within the warranty period. Normal wear
          and tear, damage from misuse, or modifications made by others are not
          covered.
        </p>

        <h2>7. Client Responsibilities</h2>
        <p>
          As a client, you are responsible for providing accurate project
          information, obtaining necessary permits (if required and not handled
          by us), ensuring access to the work area, making timely decisions,
          protecting personal belongings, and making payments according to the
          agreed schedule.
        </p>

        <h2>8. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>
          To the maximum extent permitted by law, LuxuryBath Studio's liability
          for any claims arising from our services is limited to the total
          amount paid for the specific project giving rise to the claim. We are
          not liable for indirect, incidental, or consequential damages, loss of
          use or enjoyment, damage to personal property not directly caused by
          our negligence, or delays due to circumstances beyond our reasonable
          control.
        </p>

        <h2>9. Dispute Resolution</h2>
        <p>
          In the event of a dispute, we encourage open communication to resolve
          issues amicably. If a dispute cannot be resolved through direct
          communication, we will work in good faith to find a mutually
          acceptable solution, may recommend mediation before pursuing legal
          action, and any legal proceedings shall be conducted in the
          jurisdiction of the registered office of the Website Operator.
        </p>
